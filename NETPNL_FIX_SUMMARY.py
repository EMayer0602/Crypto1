SUMMARY: Net PnL Fix for Open Matched Trades

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
================
For open matched trades, the artificial close was adding PnL instead of net PnL to capital,
while closed matched trades were correct.

This means:
- Closed trades: ‚úÖ Capital = Previous Capital + Net PnL (after fees)
- Open trades: ‚ùå Capital = Initial Capital + PnL (before fees) 

This inconsistency caused incorrect capital reporting for open positions.

FIX IMPLEMENTED:
===============
Modified simulate_matched_trades() in crypto_backtesting_module.py:

OLD CODE:
---------
# For open trades, add unrealized PnL to capital for artificial close
capital = initial_capital + unrealized_pnl

NEW CODE:
---------  
# For open trades, add NET unrealized PnL to capital for artificial close
# This ensures consistency with closed trades (always use net PnL after fees)
net_unrealized_pnl = unrealized_pnl - buy_commission
capital = initial_capital + net_unrealized_pnl

VERIFICATION:
============
‚úÖ Test script confirms fix works correctly:
   - Open trade with ‚Ç¨100 raw PnL and ‚Ç¨1 commission
   - Expected Net PnL: ‚Ç¨99
   - Expected Capital: ‚Ç¨1000 + ‚Ç¨99 = ‚Ç¨1099
   - Actual result: MATCHES expected values

‚úÖ Both trade_on modes fixed:
   - trade_on: "Open" ‚úÖ Fixed
   - trade_on: "Close" ‚úÖ Fixed

‚úÖ Closed trades remain correct:
   - No changes needed - already using Net PnL correctly

IMPACT:
======
‚úÖ Open matched trades now show correct capital calculation
‚úÖ Consistent fee handling across all trade types  
‚úÖ More accurate equity curve and PnL reporting
‚úÖ Better alignment between matched trades and extended trades
‚úÖ Eliminates discrepancy in final capital calculations

STATUS: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
