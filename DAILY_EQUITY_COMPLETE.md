ðŸŽ¯ DAILY EQUITY CURVE - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE! ðŸŽ¯
================================================================

âœ… WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED:
-----------------------

1. **CORRECTED DAILY EQUITY CALCULATION**
   - Capital updated on BUY days: Capital - Fees
   - During LONG positions: Capital + Shares * (Close - Open) DAILY
   - Capital updated on SELL days: Capital - Fees  
   - After SELL: Capital remains CONSTANT until next BUY

2. **FUNCTION REPLACED IN plotly_utils.py**
   - Old function: Only calculated at trade points
   - New function: Calculates for EVERY DAY in DataFrame
   - Uses user's EXACT specification for daily P&L

3. **TESTED AND VALIDATED**
   - test_new_equity.py: Confirmed daily variation during long
   - live_backtest_NO_EMOJIS.py: Successfully created 6 charts
   - All charts now show TRUE daily equity progression

âœ… TECHNICAL DETAILS:
--------------------

**Before (WRONG):**
```python
# Only calculated Cash + Position_Value at trade points
# Flat lines between trades
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```python
# BUY Day: current_capital -= buy_fees
# Long Days: current_capital += shares * (close - open)  # DAILY!
# SELL Day: current_capital -= sell_fees
# After SELL: constant until next BUY
```

âœ… VALIDATION RESULTS:
---------------------

From test_new_equity.py:
- Day 1: â‚¬1000.00 (start)
- Day 2: â‚¬997.50 (BUY - fees)
- Day 3: â‚¬996.38 (daily P&L)
- Day 4: â‚¬986.81 (daily P&L)  
- Day 5: â‚¬978.19 (daily P&L)
- Day 6: â‚¬975.38 (daily P&L)
- Day 7: â‚¬970.31 (daily P&L)
- Day 8: â‚¬969.39 (SELL - fees)
- Day 9: â‚¬969.39 (constant)
- Day 10: â‚¬969.39 (constant)

âœ… DAILY VARIATIONS: 5 unique values during long position!

ðŸŽ¯ ALL REQUIREMENTS MET:
-----------------------

âœ… Buy/Sell markers in charts
âœ… Trade lines with P&L per trade  
âœ… TRUE daily equity curve (not flat!)
âœ… Capital updated as specified:
   - BUY day: subtract fees
   - Long days: daily P&L = shares * (close - open)
   - SELL day: subtract fees
   - After SELL: constant

âœ… The equity curve now shows the REAL strategy performance 
   over the ENTIRE DataFrame, with daily progression!
